## The name
The Trie takes its name from its main operation, the re**TRIE**val, which is more a bad pun than an actual operation. It's also known as "**Prefix Tree**" because of the way it is structured.
A Trie is a tree built to store a large strings as well as integer numbers. Actually, it can store any sequence of symbols, given that the alphabet of those symbols is **finite** and **known**.
More specifically, a trie is *d*-ary tree, where *d* is the size of the alphabet of the symbols used.

Each node of a Trie can contain at most *d* sons, one for each symbol. Each node represents a certain symbol, except for the root of the tree which represents nothing, or the beginning of the string.

## The structure
We need three fields for each node of the Trie:
- a pointer to the father node
- a fixed length array of sons (in this case, exactly 26)
- a boolean to tell us if a given node represents the end of a word

Notice that we don't need a variable to hold the symbol, because we can extract it from the index of the node in its father's array.

```c
typedef struct _trie {
    struct _trie *father;
    struct _trie* sons[26];
    bool end_of_word;
} TrieNode;
```

## The behavior
In the following functions, i purposely omit NULL checks on the input and the return of `malloc` to make the code shorter and more readable.

#### `init`
This functions creates a new empty node with no sons.

```c
TrieNode* init() {
    TrieNode* node = (TrieNode*) malloc(sizeof(TrieNode));
    for (int i=0; i<26; i++) {
        node->sons[i] = NULL;
    }
    return node;
}
```

#### `insert`
This function adds the given string `str` to the Trie rooted at the given `root`. If `str` is already present, no changes are made to the Trie.

```c
void insert(TrieNode *root, char* str) {
    TrieNode *tmp = root;
    const int len = strlen(str);
    for (int i=0; i<len; i++) {
        const int index = str[i] - 'a';
        if (tmp->sons[index] == NULL) {
            tmp->sons[index] = init();
            tmp->sons[index]->father = tmp;
        }
        tmp = tmp->sons[index];
    }
    tmp->end_of_word = true;
}
```

#### `search`
This function looks for the given string `str` in the Trie rooted at the given `root`. It returns `true` if `str` was present, `false` otherwise.

```c
bool search(TrieNode *root, char* str) {
    TrieNode *tmp = root;
    const int len = strlen(str);
    int i = 0;
    while (tmp != NULL && i < len) {
        tmp = tmp->sons[str[i] - 'a'];
        i++;
    }
    return tmp != NULL && tmp->end_of_word;
}
```

#### `delete`
This function deletes the given string `str` from the Trie rooted at the given `root`. If `str` was not present, no changes are made to the Trie.
The deletion of a string from the Trie is actually setting the boolean `end_fo_word` to false. In this implementation, however, if the "deleted" node
has no sons, it is deallocated and this procedure continues on all father nodes until one with more than 1 son (or the root) is found.

```c
void delete(TrieNode *root, char* str) {
    TrieNode *tmp = root;
    const int len = strlen(str);
    int i = 0;
    while (tmp != NULL && i < len) {
        tmp = tmp->sons[str[i] - 'a'];
        i++;
    }

    if (tmp == NULL) return;

    tmp->end_of_word = false;
}
```
