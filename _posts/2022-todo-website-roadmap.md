I wanted to write this post to mark the beginning of a **new era**. It sounds unnecessarily solemn but it's also true. Around March 2022 (this year, actually) I created this blog because I needed a little "divulgation" platform to apply for the Summer School of HPC (and it worked) and also because I wanted to write all my dumb ideas somewhere. Now that it has served its purpose, I started looking at it with different eyes and I've seen that it's not... mine. It seemed a bit impersonal

# Future works for the website
## Graphics rework
### 1 - Throw Bootstrap in the trash
### 2 - Design the new graphics
The whole website could be a giant terminal but usable (*clickable*) like a GUI.
## Diversification of interests
### 1 - The Gallery
Collection of my Blender wallpapers. Also divided in collections.
### 2 - The Library
Collection of my little stories.
### 3 - The Game Corner
Collection of my board games.
### 4 - The Studio (?)
Collection of my favourite programs.
