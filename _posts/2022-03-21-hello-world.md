Hi everyone!

My name's Filippo Barbari, or Ledmington on [GitHub](https://github.com/Ledmington) (don't forget the capital L), but you may have already guessed it since you're on this page.

I love Computer Science and, in particular, I love **reinventing the wheel**: whenever I need some specific feature, I prefer to implement it from scratch rather than using someone else's code. This is the perfect method to deeply understand a new concept but is also a very very slow and unproductive way to work.

## What is this blog about?
I decided to start this blog to have a place where I can write some of the ideas that always run around my mind. Be prepared for some really technical posts about algorithms implementations but also for highly abstract dissertations about ... idk, the we-live-in-a-simulation thing, just to name one.

The main topics of this blog:
 - **algorithms**, because they are fun
 - **data structures**, because I don't want to leave algorithms alone
 - **parallelism**, because I like seeing the 100% usage in the task manager
 - **esoteric programming languages**, because they are creative
 - my thoughts about everything, because this is my website

## Some trivia about me
I am a backend type of guy. The unly UIs I like are the CLIs and the ones with lots of configurations.

I prefer and use tabs. Because there's no reason other than "reducing file size" to use spaces.

I absolutely hate the curly brackets on the next line of a class declaration or a loop.

I like curly brackets instead of significant indentation.

Best programming language? C.

Best data structure? Trie.

Best algorithm? BFS.

Best library/framework? CUDA.

Best CLI? Docker (and PyTest is second).

Best GUI? Intellij IDEA.
