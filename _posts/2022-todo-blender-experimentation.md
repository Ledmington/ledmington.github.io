Some time ago, (more than a year ago, actually) I started messing around with Blender. I learnt the basics during the Computer Graphics course in the third year of my bachelor's degree. I really liked it, it was something completely new to me: 3D modeling, animations, textures ecc. I liked it so much that, months after the end of the course, I still wanted to use it and I started creating some wallpapers: 3D scenes with lots of geometry and usually a single point-light source. It was fun but it ended quickly due to exams and other complications. Now I feel that I have more free time to dedicate to some hobby other than videogames and programming so, I'm starting to mess around again with it. This time I want to actually study something that I could never understand completely: materials. I want to be able to create my own library of materials so that creating new scenes and wallpapers would much faster.

Here I will gather the results of my experimentation with materials, especially with (sorted by increasing difficulty):
 - neon
 - wood
 - dirty/opaque metal
 - shiny/clean metal
 - glass
