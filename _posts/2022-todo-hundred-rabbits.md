This post will be pretty long and more phylosofical/thoughtful than the others, so get comfortable and relax.

One of the many things that my father taught me is this:
> If you know how to do enough stuff, you can live however you want.

Which is just a different, and more specific, way to express
> Scientia potentia est

From latin, "Knowledge is power".

What my father meant was that, if you don't know how to repair your oven, or your car, or your computer, your life will always be dependent on the people that can repair that stuff.


## A story of old Macbooks, solar panels and boats

appunti per email:
- why "hundredrabbits"?
- why a boat? why not just living really far away from society and civilization, in a cottage maybe?
- how do you define yourselves? are you transgender or non-binary or something else?
- what are your plans for your next voyages?
- what are your plans for your next software products? are you planning on creating a really minimal and low-power OS?
- are you planning on trying to develop some low-power hardware? Like arduino?
- can you sustain yourselves with just the patreon?
- how do you deal with creativity? i know that you're travelling a lot and always seeing new places but i also know that, for many weeks in a row you see nothing but see on the horizon. Isn't it boring?

appunti per domande personali:
- how is the life in an "unusual" couple like you?
