# What is the PRACE Summer School of HPC?

# The project I'll be working on
It's called "Designing scientific application on GPUs" (you can look it up [here](https://summerofhpc.prace-ri.eu/designing-scientific-applications-on-gpus-2/)) and, as far as I understood it, it consists of translating some known algorithms written in C/C++ into C+CUDA.

I will have a personal desk and access to the IRIS cluster of the University of Luxembourg (the one in the photo). If you take a look over [here](https://hpc.uni.lu/old/systems/iris/), you can see the detailed specs. Since I'll be working with CUDA, I'm actually interested in the "GPGPU accelerators" part:
- 18 nodes
- each one with 4 NVIDIA Tesla V100
