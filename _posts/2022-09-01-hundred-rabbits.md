This post will be pretty long and more phylosofical/thoughtful than the others, so get comfortable and relax.

One of the many things that my father taught me is this:
> If you know how to do enough stuff, you can live however you want.

Which is just a different, and more specific, way to express
> Scientia potentia est

From latin, "Knowledge is power".

What my father meant was that, if you don't know how to repair your oven, or your car, or your computer, your life will always be dependent on the people that can repair that stuff.
